# E-Commerce Flower Shop
As a personal project to practice front-end skills, I have decided to begin a personal project, a sort of clone project of a ecommerce flower shop website. 
I have always loved the thought of being a florist one day in another life, and that was my inspiration. I decided to imagine to do a personal project of how
how I would want my website to look like if I was a florist.
